### Android scanner (Minimum Viable Product)
Notable points and flaws that can be fixed in future:
* Works with Android API 23
* Doesn't use ubiMqtt (uses eclipse paho)
* Handels all BLE signals the same way (doesn't differ beacons)
* Doesn't work with regular bluetooth signals
* Has a delay (1.5 - 2.5s) between scanning waves
